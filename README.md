# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary and Results
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The county results were:
   -  Jefferson County: 38,855 votes, or 10.5% of the votes.
   -  Denver County: 306,055 votes, or 82.8% of the votes.
   -  Arapahoe County: 24,801 votes, or 6.7% of the votes.

The largest voter turnout was in Denver County, with 306,055 votes, or 82.8% of all votes cast.

The candidate results were:
   -  Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 (23.0%) of the votes.
   -  Diana DeGette received 272,892 (73.8%) of the votes.
   -  Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 (3.1%) of the votes.
   
The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, who received 272,892, or 73.8%, of the votes.

## Challenge Overview
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to determine the number of votes cast per candidate, percentage of the final votes per candidate, and the winner of the election. The election commission asked for additional data to include voter turnout for each county, percentage of votes from each county of of the total count, and which county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary
I propose that the election committee utilize the code that was developed for this audit in future elections. The code is versatile and can be used in any size election, big or small, and can easily be modified for federal elections, adding an if-statement to include state data similar to the county data included herein. The code could also be revised to explore more granular data, such as voter ethnicity, age, and gender, which is of interest to candidates. In summary, this code is a valuable tool that can be used by the Colorado Board of Elections in for any sized election for many years to come.
